This project is a simple timing and reflex game developed using Unity and C#. In the game, random keyboard keys light up on the screen, and the player must press the correct key at the right time. The goal is to keep the game going by pressing the correct keys quickly and accurately. It includes keyboard input tracking and UI feedback.
